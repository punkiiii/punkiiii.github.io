			wow........ doing great man! keep it up!! dumbass can't commit to something for longer than 2 days! whatever, i'm trying this again for something to do. <br>
			dunno if i will be consistent or ever update this again at all but w/e !! <br> 
			idk feeling meh as per usual, schools ending soon, i'm terrified, i have no plans and no ambitions, genuinely didn't plan this far ahead and now i don't know where to start. <br>
			i'm not good enough at music to justify commiting to it, i never learned things properly anyway. i don't care enough about tech to want to do anything relating to it. <br>
			i don't feel like i enjoy much of anything else too. i've been getting back into bali's recently and thats been super fun, but thats a toy not a sustainable job! shows how mature i am. <br>
			i've been listening to a lot of <a href="https://karaswalkhome.bandcamp.com/album/look-a-rainbow" target="_blank"> kara's walk home </a> recently, and i've been thinking a lot about the end of my life. (calm down edgelord) <br>

			to be honest I was hurt myself <br>
			<br>
			if I could live 100 more years <br>
			you know that I would take  <br>
			and I hope you’d take it too <br>
			<br>
			sitting in the park <br>
			swinging in the dark <br>
			I felt so stupid and young
			<br>
			so I’m sorry
			<br>
			oh god I’m sorry"<br>

			i don't know if i would live for 100 more years if i could. i don't think my life would get better and i don't think i could handle watching everyone i loved leave me.<br>
			i think my friend said it best "i feel like my answer would still be no, i think a life well lived is long enough and doesnt need to be extended for it to be a good one" <br>
			i agree with this and i think everything should end at somepoint. it's not healthy to keep expending life on something that's dying. both literally and metaphorically. <br>
			a good life can be a short or long, it all depends on the quality of the person and wether or not they tried to put something good into the world. <br>
			<br>
			art is important, i think it's one way people can justify their life in a way that doesn't (or hopefully doesn't) exploit others. <br>
			so even if you feel like you're not creative or not good enough at any type of creative thing...<br>
			fuck that mindset and create something, make something that only you could ever make and share it to the world with an open heart and mind because that's the only way you can communicate the truest version of you. <br>
			show exactly what you love and what you hate, what you want to be and what you want to hide, it's all something you can express through your art regardless of skill or medium. <br> 
			all it takes is the want to do so.
