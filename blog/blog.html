			what am i doing with my life, where do i go from here, i can't get a job and i have nothing that i'm actually passionate about. so what do i do? <br>
			i think i struggle with emotional permanence the most. i feel like if i don't talk to someone for a while they probably don't like me and i shouldn't care about them. <br>
			i'm scared of commitment in a lot of ways too. <br>
			semi unrelated thought...<br>
			i don't get the appeal of alcohol, i've never been drunk but it doesn't seem fun or enjoyable and hangovers sound horrible, though maybe i'm scared of not being in full control of my thoughts. which is the more likely scenario. <br>
			idk i'm scared for the people around me, but that's probably because i'm trained to be scared of everything.<br>
			i need to fix the header on this, most of it is under the body section and that doesn't seem sustainable but idk if i can put it under the head section, html is wack...

			so i don't really know why i'm making this, i don't even know if i will make it public, i probably will
			im enjoying this so far though. this isn't the first time i've tried to do this but this is the first time i'm making myself commit to trying.<br>
			i have a tendency to give up when things get hard and that could totally happen here but i'm working to improve myself.<br>
			i'm not really doing this to improve at coding, more to have a place that i can customize cause i like the look lmao.
			i don't plan to make this anything fancy or official and if it becomes that i've become a fed.<br>
			idk if this is even worth my time but i'll try to have fun with this.<br>
			<br>
			that all being said how the <i>hell</i> do you host a website im broke fr
