			why am i so mad all the time, i wake up and i'm already annoyed. i had this dream last night that really got on my nerves. <br>
			synopsis of the dream without leaking anything was i'm talking to a friend of a friend, they're telling me about how my friend talks about me to them.<br>
			we make a deal, i do something in return and they find out how my friend actually feels about me. <br>
			there's a small group of us i should add, all of them assuring me that my friend genuinely does like me i'm just in my head about it. DREAM END! <br>
			i woke up and since then i'm still thinking about the dream, i got up at 5:45am and it's 5:36pm... <br>
			i just want to know what they actually think of me, am i an annoyance or am i some one they genuinely want to be friends with. <br>
			wish i could say more without being completely obvious about who this is about just incase they see this ever. <br>
			<br>
			i also have other things, relationships and people i would <i>love</i> to complain about, but i also hate confrontation and if you don't know me none of this means anything and theres something beautiful about that. <3 
			
			one more note, would it be weird for me to go back and write notes on previous dates. i would format it ~~~ (note/4/29/23~~whatever i want to say) <br>
			maybe i should just cite things in later posts, maybe that's better. also thinking about separating things into their own pages, so there would be a separate page for every day.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			i decided to do this so hiiii new formatting !!!
