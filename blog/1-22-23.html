			so i don't really know why i'm making this, i don't even know if i will make it public, i probably will
			im enjoying this so far though. this isn't the first time i've tried to do this but this is the first time i'm making myself commit to trying.<br>
			i have a tendency to give up when things get hard and that could totally happen here but i'm working to improve myself.<br>
			i'm not really doing this to improve at coding, more to have a place that i can customize cause i like the look lmao.
			i don't plan to make this anything fancy or official and if it becomes that i've become a fed.<br>
			idk if this is even worth my time but i'll try to have fun with this.<br>
			<br>
			that all being said how the <i>hell</i> do you host a website im broke fr
